This project was created based on a course I took. In it, I worked on my skills with React, React Native, TypeScript, styled-components, Express, and MongoDB. To make the app work, you need to open the integrated terminal
in the "API" folder, where the backend is located. Once in the folder, you should type "npm start" or "yarn start." After this, open the integrated terminal in the "fe" folder, where the frontend is located. Once the terminal
is open, type "npm run dev" or "yarn dev" to start the app. To open the app on mobile, you need to install the Expo app on your phone. After installing the app, open the integrated terminal in the "APP" folder within the
"Project WAITER Mobile 2" directory and type the command "npm start" or "yarn start." Scan the generated QR code to use the mobile app. Make sure that the network is the same as your database.
